/*
 * Using this SCSS file
 * ====================
 *
 * This file system is organized using a variation of Atomic Design,
 * styles are organized from small parts (atoms), to full pages (templates).
 *
 * In addition, there are helper functions and mixins that are defined first.
 * If this is done properly, there will be no repeat styles, and little to no overriding.
 *
 * As a style guide, keep nesting to a maximum of 3 levels (not including pseudo selectors),
 * limit use of advanced selectors (>, +, ~, etc), and avoid use of IDs if possible.
 *
 *
 * Definitions
 * -----------
 * Atoms     - element styles, small building blocks (buttons, inputs, images)
 * Molecules - combination of atoms (forms, widgets)
 * Organisms - multiple molecules (header, sidebar, footer)
 * Templates - multiple organisms (posts, archives)
 * Pages     - page specific overrides of templates
